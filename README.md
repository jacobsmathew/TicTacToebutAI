# TicTacToebutAI
This is a fundamental Tic-Tac-Toe game where you can compete against a sophisticated artificial intelligence opponent. 
The game features three distinct difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard. 
Easy mode pits you against a randomly acting AI, while Medium mode presents a more dynamic opponent that learns from your moves and adapts its strategy accordingly. 
Hard mode is virtually unbeatable, as it will either force a draw or guarantee its own victory.
